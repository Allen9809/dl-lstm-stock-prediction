# dl-lstm-stock-prediction

In this project, I employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) regressor to perform time series prediction, specifically forecasting Apple's stock price lag days into the future. I utilize a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture, which is particularly adept at addressing the optimization challenges typically associated with RNNs, ensuring more accurate and reliable predictions.
